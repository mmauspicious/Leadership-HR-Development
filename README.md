**Problem Statement**

We conducted a survey across five organizational units—Technical, Quality, Product, HR, and R&D Managers—with the results compiled into a CSV file. For this survey, we asked 30 questions, as detailed in the questionnaire file provided in [1]. Each question is aligned with one of the Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership:

    Model The Way
    Inspire a Vision
    Challenge the Process
    Enable Others to Act
    Encourage the Heart

Within each of the five units, responses were collected from four respondent groups: Self, Other Managers, CEO, and Team Members. Participants responded using a numerical response scale as follows:

    1: Almost Never
    2: Rarely
    3: Seldom
    4: Once in a While
    5: Occasionally
    6: Sometimes
    7: Fairly Often
    8: Usually
    9: Very Frequently
    10: Almost Always

Objective:
Based on the survey data, produce comprehensive outputs that include:

    A detailed operational analysis
    Individual, team, and organizational-level results
    An actionable improvement plan

The ultimate goal is to develop and nurture better managers within our organization.

This project is inspired by [The Leadership Challenge: Activities Book - Barry Posner, Elaine Biech, and James M. Kouzes].
